## Known bugs

- search does not reset after submit
- infinite scroll is buggy and not concating state
- infinite scroll overflow messes with the hover on cards

## Wishlist

- fix bugs
- write tests
- implement everything API (I used top-headlines)
- add a footer
- use state management / context api
- instead of params use querystring
- error pages on dead routes
- have a toggle view for bigger / smaller cards
- use typeahead on search and maybe the dropdown
